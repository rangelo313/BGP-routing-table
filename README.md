# BGP-routing-table
develop a program to analyze the BGP routing table to get the following connectivity property of the Internet AS graph.: the set of neighboring ASes of each AS.
will output the top 10 ASes in terms of the number of neighbors they have. The top 10 ASes should be printed in the descending (non-increasing) order based on the number of neighbors they have.
